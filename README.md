- They are defined by enclosing elemented in parenthesis/small brackets (). 

## Sets
- They are unordered collection of unique elements (cannot have identical elements)
- They are useful for membership testing, removing duplicates from a sequence, and mathematical operations like union, intersection and difference 
- Cannot access elements using index operator []. Need to check if the elements exists in the set 
- They are defined by enclosing elements in curly brackets {}

## Dictionaries
